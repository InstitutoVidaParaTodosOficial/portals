    "summary": "The Instituto Vida Para Todos (IVPT) is an essential channel for spreading the Lord's work, but it is not limited to a simple platform for videos and publications. Its role is that of a preacher of the gospel of the kingdom, faithfully proclaiming the only gospel: the gospel of Christ (Gal 1:4). IVPT's mission is to give global reach to the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom with just one click. As it is written in Psalm 19:4: 'Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world,' the prophetic Word transmitted by IVPT reaches distant places and, with this breadth, touches hearts, generating the hearing of faith in people.",
    "title": "Our Mission",
    "subtitle": "In addition to its evangelistic function, IVPT plays a legal and administrative role within the work, or in the various fronts of work that you will get to know below.",
    "descripttion": "To fully accomplish its mission, IVPT cooperates with all available tools: Colportage, PAC, CEAPE, Foreign Missions, Expolivro, TCI, Kids' Winners Factory, Care Network and Reception Center, Tree of Life Publisher, Kingdom Investors, and Tree of Life Ranch, working in unity so that the gospel of the kingdom is preached throughout the earth, to bring our Lord back one day sooner."

    "description": "Just as God has greatly blessed the expansion of the work in all regions of the globe, especially in Africa and Asia, the need to send missionaries has increased significantly.\n\nAlthough IVPT has digital coverage in all territories of the planet, for the church tree to be planted and expand, bringing the benefit of God's life to all, as well as fulfilling the desire of God's heart, our frontline team needs to be on the streets, bringing the prophetic word, establishing work centers, promoting colportage, and raising up local missionaries to consolidate these regions.",
    "details": "Sending missionaries involves purchasing tickets, accommodation, food, logistics, transportation, as well as renting colporteur houses, buying and building work centers (in Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia), and printing books.\n\nTo support this wonderful front of work, the **KINGDOM INVESTORS** project was created, which consists of monthly offerings determined by quotas of R$ 500.00. Many people have had their hearts won by this project and have become Kingdom Investors.\n\n**Thus, the main focus is to have a financial base that can sustain the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom throughout the earth.**",
